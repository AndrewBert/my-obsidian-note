# The Human Need for a Moral Authority

## The Inherent Desire for an Ultimate Moral Authority
Humans seem to have an inherent need for an ultimate moral authority. This need is deeply useful because, without such an authority, morality becomes subjective, which means it could change unpredictably—even in ways we might currently find horrifying, such as slavery becoming legal again. The idea of an unchanging moral authority provides stability and a safeguard against such shifts.

## The Bias Toward Objective Morality
The existence of this need does not necessarily mean that an ultimate moral authority actually exists—it may just be a useful construct. If I were debating someone who believes that God is the ultimate moral authority, I would ask:

> **"Don't you think humans have a strong bias toward wanting an objective moral foundation?"**

Having one makes arguments more persuasive—it allows someone to say, *"this is just how things are"* rather than *"this is just my opinion."* That’s a powerful rhetorical tool, both for maintaining social order and for enforcing moral norms.

## Religion as a Social Tool
This bias could explain why religions emerged in the first place—because an unchanging moral authority is incredibly effective, not necessarily because it's **true**. 

Of course, moral values have changed over time. Some moral shifts (such as the eventual acceptance of gay marriage) seem like positive progress, even when religious institutions initially opposed them. So while a fixed moral authority can be comforting, moral evolution isn’t always bad.

## Implications for Objective Morality
Someone who believes in objective morality would at least have to acknowledge that the human desire for a moral authority exists. That acknowledgment, in turn, raises questions about whether religious claims to truth are based on reality or just on their usefulness in shaping human behavior.

For me, this is part of a broader set of reasons why I don’t find any particular religion—Christianity or otherwise—to be definitively true.
